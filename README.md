# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Portfolio

---

This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I have attained from my BSc H in Mathematics and online Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

It includes tutorials, exercises, projects and coursework I have completed using real-world data sets. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience in this field. I aim to work as a data scientist by mid-2023.
