# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio


This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I have attained from my BSc H in Mathematics and online Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

It includes tutorials, exercises, projects and coursework I have completed using real-world data sets. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience in this field. I aim to work as a data scientist by mid-2023. 
 
Languages: Python, R

**My Top Projects**

- [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/adilsaid64/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Practical:%206%20Real-World%20Applications/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%20(2).ipynb)

    - Used a Support Vector Machine Classifier to classify cancer cells as Malignant or Benign.
    - Result: Built a model that achieves 97% accuracy.
    - Skills: Machine Learning, Model Evaluation, Optimization

- [Movie Ratings](https://github.com/adilsaid64/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20&%20Data%20Science%20Masterclass/Moving%20Ratings%20EDA.ipynb)
    - An EDA Project. How much can you trust the ratings shown on a movie online? Especially when the same company showing the ratings makes money from selling tickets? Is there a conflict of intrest for companies selling movie tickets and displaying movie ratings?
    - Result: Found out that the company was over rating movies.
    - Skills: EDA, Data Analysis, Problem Solving


- [Bayesian Spatial Analysis]()
: Final Year University Project...(soon)
