# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Portfolio


This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I have attained from my BSc H in Mathematics and online Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

It includes tutorials, exercises, projects and coursework I have completed using real-world data sets. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience in this field. I aim to work as a data scientist by mid-2023. 
 

Languages: Python, R
