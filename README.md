# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I have attained from my BSc H in Mathematics and online Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

It includes tutorials, exercises, projects and coursework I have completed using real-world data sets. The goal is to build up my knowledge, confidence, and experience in this field. I aim to work as a data scientist by mid-2023. 

Projects include:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Financial Time Series Analysis
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. K Nearest Neighbours
6. Decision Trees and Random Forests
7. Support Vector Machines
8. K Means Clustering
9. Principle Component Analysis
10. Natural Language Processing

Sometimes GitHub has errors rendering notebooks. So they can be seen via this link too: https://nbviewer.org/github/adilsaid64/.
